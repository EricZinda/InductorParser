Inductor Parser
===============

To Build
--------
indparse is designed to be built with [CMake](https://cmake.org) like this:

1. [Install CMake on your machine](https://cmake.org/install/)
2. Go to the root of the guffparse repository and create a build directory.  On unix-style machines:
	`mkdir build`
3. Change to that directory. On unix-style machines:
	`cd build`
4. Use CMake to setup the build system:
	`cmake ../src`
5. Then actually do the build:
	`make`
